# #list comprehension is used to make list using concise syntax. we have to apply expression on each item in list to create new list in given range
# list=[2,4,5,7,8]
# res=[val **2 for val in list]
# print(res)

# a=[1,2,3,4,5,6]
# res=[val for val in a if val%2==0]
# print(res)


#ternary operator
#suppose want to check wheether no is even or odd we can use ternay operator over here to check this
num=5
res="even"if num%2==0 else "odd"
print(res)
#max of two numbers
num1=6
num2=10
